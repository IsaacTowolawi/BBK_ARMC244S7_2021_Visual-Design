                        <p>PNG-24  preserves more colour and more contrast with the image whereas png-8 does not meet the image quality required for an online representation.
                            This image was created specifically for the magazine cover for Bleach. It is to represent an integral character in the anime series.The final piece is indicative of the beginning of the end within the series. It Displays the main characters' names within the series and an image of a yacht who does not come until very late in the series.
                            </p>
                        <h4>CREATIVE PROCESS: </h4>
                        <ul>
                        <li>I first I first downloaded the image from bleach.fandom.com</li>
                        <li>I then proceeded on to Photoshop and created a new layer And added the image onto Photoshop then duplicated it. </li>
                        <li>The next step was to remove as much background as possible on the duplicate layer, so I used both the blending option and the Magic eraser tool kit. “Blend if” > selected Blue > This layer and set it to 68 / 147.</li>
                        <li>The next step was to find a color that would be appropriate for a color dodge > colors chosen were  f9e068 > ffa200 > fee989.</li>
                        <li>Then I proceeded to color dodge the image, the goal was to make it  brighter than the original image so when animating it in gif form, it would be distinct from the flames radiating around the character.</li>
                        <li>I created an additional two layers with different color swatches > fffef3 and ffc000 both added to the color dodge mode.</li>
                        <li>I then started using the pen tool to trace around the main charatch of the image. Once completed > i right clicked and selected make selection > then click crtl + j to create a new layer with the traced image (this process was completed twice).</li>
                        <li>The next goal was to make sure I removed as much coloring as i could with the new selected layers so it would only show the line art.</li>
                        <li>Once completed, I went to the top of the screen > click the window option, and scrolled down to the timeframe.</li>
                        <li>Which showed a video timeline displaying all 8 layers > i click on the “cog” icon and made sure i check “Loop Playback”.</li>
                        <li>The Gif animation was set to 30 frames per seconds and will last for 11 seconds.</li>
                        <li>Now i want to move specific layers > so i click on arrow for upper_power_body layer > made sure i moved the cursor at the beginning of the time line > selected the “position” mode and created a keyframe.</li>
                        <li>I then move further across the timeline > clicked on the move tool on the toolbar > and pressed on the “up arrow” key on my keyboard to raise the position of the layer. I did this process for all the layers.</li>
                        <li>For the color dodge layers i created a keyframe for the opacity mode > Starting on the first frame and set the opacity to 100% then I moved further down the time frame and set the opacity to 50% i did this for the duration of the 11 second animation > to emphasise a glowing effect.</li>
                        <li>The next step was to add BAN-KIA to the beginning of the gif. Short Bleach history lesson: The Ban-kai is the final form or full release of the Shinigami’s sword (also known as a zanpakuto). </li>
                        <li>I used the font “manga temple” to give the affect of the image coming from the manga.</li>
