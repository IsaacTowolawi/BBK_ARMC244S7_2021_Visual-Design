                <ul>
                <li>Firstly, I downloaded the image from source: bleach.fandom.com</li>
                <li>Secondly, I began the process of removing the background from the image which consisted of, adding the image to photoshop > creating an new layer > going into my layer options by double clicking the new created layer > finding the blending options > “blend if” option > then selecting the blue chanel because it has the most levels of contrast between the character and the background> primarily focusing on the “this layer” option which would allow me to selected and alter the different values of the image. > and sliding it down till it was acceptable. </li>
                <li>Thirdly, I added a feathering option to help with making my image more transparent>  this consisted of a continuing on the blend option going back to blender and holding on alt on my windows key and dragging down this layer until it met my satisfaction. This process was simplistic due to the image not having many components to it.</li>
                <li>Fourthly, I wanted To add a colour splash to the image. so I Began the process of making the image Black and White by coping/creating two extra layers >1 colour mask and the other desaturate >  and then selected the saturates layer and had both the colour mask layer and the background layer >  I went to the image option on the top of my screen click on adjustments and scroll down to the desaturate. This changed the image to Black & White. > The next step was to select my colour mask layer > go to the top of my screen and click on the “Select” option > scroll down to “Colour Range'' which would display a new window box > i then selected the “eyedropper tool” and marked which color i wanted to save for instance the color range tool allows the user to keep color on an image by selected the white spaces of that image. I wanted to keep the eye colour of my image, so I was primarily selecting the eyes. > added it to the layer mask and had my finished piece.</li>

            <li>I downloaded the image from source: bleach.fandom.com</li>

            <li>To remove The first character in the image I used the pen tool to individually select on the subjects silhouette > This will then create a new layer called “The Shape” layer >  I selected the shape layer and duplicated it > converted the shape to a selection > went to the top window and selected the selection option > and scrolled down and selected the “transform selection” option. This will allow me to move or resize the selected image freely. > I went back to the first layer and copied it then pasted it to the selected shape layer. > i then went to the tools>clone stomp> and increased the hardness to 10% >opacity to 70% and change the brush size to 420px> i then held  alt + the spot i wanted to copy. > the copied layered allowed me to add to the smoky cloud effect in the character that i wanted to show just for Rukiai.</li>

                    This image was downloaded from the bleach.fandom.com website
                    </li>
                <li>Fortunately. For me, the background image was already removed, so I decided to add some subtle color to add more of a glowy effect.</li>
                <li>I first created a flat layer using “ctrl + alt + shift + e”.</li>
                <li>Once created. I went to the top of the screen and changed the “Mode” option from “Normal” to “Color Dodge” > from there I selected the brush tool and held alt + the right mouse key and to pick the color I wanted to use to color dodge. </li>
                <li>I shifted the Opacity to 59% > Flow 35% > Smoothing 11% > Brush Hardness to 57% and Brush Size 45px.</li>
                <li>The primary goal was to add a bit of a colour spillage on the image to emphasize that the sword is paramount to the whole ashetectic to the magazine page.</li>
                <li>This image represents the dark side of my interactive magazine. As reiterated above the magazine is more so an info-mag for different characters that are integral to the anime. I thought showing one of the main characters that would indicate the future or end of the series was important to me.</li>
                <li>Again not much was done with this image, i did not feel like it would have been affected if i added hue/saturation to this image. I have an idea of a minimalist info-mag and I felt like I was stuck with that. </li>

                <li>
                    I began by downloading the image on pinterest.com but all rights reserved to shonen jump.
                    </li>
                <li>It appeared the image was already edited but I wanted to use the image for my back cover for the magazine. </li>
                <li>The was to not completely alter the image but just a section of the image so it would pop.</li>
                <li>I opened photoshop and dragged the image to it > i then pressed “p” for the pen tool and went around the “eyes” portion of the image > once completed, i right clicked and scrolled down to “make selection” this allowed me to select just a part I needed. next I clicked on ctrl + J space to create a new layer then hit the new layer when back to the previous image layer and use the eraser tool to start  removing the colour From behind so there would be nothing there I did this manually due to be blend off Plenty option not being forthcoming > next once I was being treated and went back to the new layer I created and and click be fully brush tool > went to the color swatch and type ff0000 for the brightest and deepest red i could get. Mode set to Color Dodge > Opacity set to 100% > Flow 100% > smoothing 16%. I then proceeded to paint the eye until i was satisfied with the results.</li>
                <li>I added a few more touches to the hair around the eye to make it look right. </li>
                <li>This was the least i did to an image ive worked on this project but, i wanted a staple peace for the back cover of my magazine & i believe the it cam out well.</li>
