He could not speak could not hear or see and was entirely motionless. Despite these hindrances the child feared nothing because he instinctively knew that he would survive. People afflicted with either a physical mental or spiritual handicap would touch the child and as a result were healed of their respective illnesses. This was do to the baby\u2019s inherit spiritual ability to distrib- ute his soul onto others. As the fragments of the child\u2019s soul began healing the afflicted they in turn became imprinted with aspects of the souls of those people. Once the pieces of the child\u2019s soul completed the healing they would immedi- ately return to the child resulting in the deaths of their recipients. Despite the fact that none of the people who were healed by the child lived for very long the child continued to be surround and venerated by the masses. In time the child started to develop his own senses as well as his mobility following the return of the pieces of his soul. Just as he became able to hear the boy noticed how the people were calling him by their god\u2019s name: \u201cYHWACH\u201d. The child chose to take up this name as his own.

He is the monarch of the Wandenreich and Father of the Quincy. He also possesses the designation \u201cA\u201d - \u201cThe Almighty\u201d and is the son of the Soul King. He seeks to de- stroy all life in the world around him and recreate it in his own image. Being the creator of the Quin- cy he is indirectly responsible for various events that have occurred throughout the series most notably is the birth of Ichigo Kurosaki and his ac- cess to his Quincy powers Zangetsu.

Yhwach himself identifies as being the Soul King\u2019s son thus implying that the Quincy are also related to the Soul King. His unique spiritual abilities directly infer an ancestry with the Soul King who\u2019s purpose is to maintain the balance between birth and death via soul distribution be- tween the Human World Soul Society and Hueco Mundo.
