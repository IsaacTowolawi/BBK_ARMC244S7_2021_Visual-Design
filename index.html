                        <h2>BLEACH</h2>
                        <p>
                            The goal was to create an interactive magazine based on the popular Anime series BLEACH.
                            Fitting the theme of most of my assignments i wanted to introduce people to popular anime
                            series of the 21st century. I looked to BLEACH forums that I would constantly use
                            for inspiration. I initially wanted to develop an interactive multimedia player on mobile,
                            which would display the most popular anime scenes in video form but, opted for a magazine
                            due to its simplicity and the somewhat impact it could have on specific readers who want to get into
                            anime. This magazine is meant to be a casual introduction to the popular series and
                            information about specific characters in the show.
